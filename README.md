# SoundBlock

Soundblock is a block-based interface for Sonic Pi, a music programming language. 
Similar to scratch, it allows the user to write non-code code, using loop blocks 
and music blocks to do so. Soundblock provides music lovers a way to make sounds differently, 
but without the steep learning curve of coding.
